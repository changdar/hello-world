# hello-world
Hi There!

My name is Darren Chang. I'm a Designer who is an analytical and organized thinker and I find creative solutions to balance visual design with functional design. 

I offer a wealth of knowledge having worked with top companies developing UX and Visual Design. This includes creating wireframes, flows and guidelines to create the graphic and marketing needs. 

I've developed creative for responsive design, HTML 5 games, and App creative. This allows me to work closely with other teams such as Engineering, Product Leads, Producers, QA, Creative, and Third Party Vendors.

I enjoy being on the cusp of new technology and like to collaborate with development teams to get the best results.
